- 👋 Hi, I’m Katrina Claw, PhD @ClawIndigenousGenomicsEthicsLab
- 👀 I’m interested in the genomic and metabolomic investigation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways in human populations and understanding the ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research.
- 💞️ My research goals are to personalize medicine by using genetic information and biomarkers to tailor treatment. To this end, my research projects focus on studying pharmacogenes and genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in various human populations.
- 📫 Reach me at Katrina.Claw@CUAnschutz.edu or my PRA, Crystal.Musser@CUAnschutz.edu
